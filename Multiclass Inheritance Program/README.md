This program is designed to read the given comma delimited text file and tokenize the data based on the information given. The data is 
then categorized by determining if the data is that of a standard, auto, or property policy and achieves this by inheritance. 

The Policy subclass is the parent class of the Policyauto and Policyproperty subclasses because the policy subclass holds basic data 
that the other subclasses use. By using inheritance it is easy to get that data into the Policyauto and Policyproperty objects without 
having to type it into each one.
